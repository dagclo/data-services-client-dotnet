 * Address Correction
 *
 * The Address Correction data service validates and corrects postal addresses from around the world.  The service is currently available for the following countries: United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. Address correction standardizes address spellings, abbreviations, and formats, adds additional delivery information, such as geocodes, and verifies the deliverability of each address.  It improves your delivery success odds by correcting incorrect information, such as postal codes and typos in street names, and verifying delivery target names.  Key functionality: * Corrects the spelling of street names and cities. * Standardizes address formats and abbreviations, based on country ID. * Enriches output with deliverability information for an address, such as USPS DPVÂ® confirmation and geocoding coordinates. * Provides easy-to-understand correction status, codes, and messages.
