/* 
 * Job management
 *
 * A service that allows management and querying of data services jobs.  Some of the important traits of jobs are:  * A job has a unique `job_id`. * A job can have widely different life-cycles. Typically they represent a single batch job, but they can also represent interactions with the data services that span multiple sessions. * Jobs form a convenient 'container' for registering data service usage, stored and updated on an hourly basis. * When invoking data services, the `job_id` value should be passed in via the `Job-ID` HTTP header in order to register the specific service usage under a specific job. * If no `Job-ID` header is provided, all users also have a surrogate job called `users/{user_id}` which all other data service usage is registered against. * Jobs can exist in hierarchies. A job is considered a child/sub-job of another job when the `parent_job` attribute is set. * Job metadata such as `expected_services` and `expected_record_count` help in reserving necesary credits and other resources when specified. * Normally jobs are owned by an individual user and can only be accessed by this user. But there can also be tenant-scoped jobs in which case the job data can be accessed and managed by all members of the tenant with the relevant roles.
