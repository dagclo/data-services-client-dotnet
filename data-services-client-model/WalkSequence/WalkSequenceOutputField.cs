/* 
 * Walk Sequence
 *
 * Appends USPS Walk Sequence numbers to mail pieces.  ## Job execution  The general flow to execute a batch job is to:  1. Create a job while specifying upload format (input fields) and download (output fields). 2. Upload records to process via one or more calls to the API. Records are uploaded in blocks. The records are    persisted until at least the end of the job. 3. Initiate processing by calling the `_run` endpoint. 4. Wait for the job status to enter `SUCCESS` or `FAILED`. 5. Download the records. 6. Delete job as appropriate.  ## Records  Records must be uploaded completely prior to running the service. Records are categorized as `input` or `output`. See Pagination for more information.  ## Pagination Records for a job are broken into pages (`page_id`) for retrieval. The collection of record page IDs are available and must be retrieved as a precursor to downloading records. Each record page can then be retrieved by the client. Page IDs are immutable and can be retrieved multiple times if needed.
